# AQC Net PH

This project utilizes image-based air quality monitoring through deep learning using low-cost particulate matter sensors. 

## Dependencies
Running the following command will install the prerequesites needed

This model uses a deep convolutional neural network model AQC-Net based on ResNet in addition to the addition of the self supervision model SCA that estimates air pollution by using both PM2.5 and PM10 concentration levels.
